Hello l'ami, so you're a prospector now?

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,278
{\a2}Well...

3
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,944
<b>There's</b> not {b}much{/b} to it you know.

4
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:15,889
<i>We just earn</i> our {i}keep by wandering{/i} this land to find riches.

5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:17,694
<u>But when</u> we find {u}something{/u}

6
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:19,163
<font color="yellow">well...</font>

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,897
<font color="#DB2937">The guild wants its cut.</font>

8
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:25,500
We start in the spring and work until the first snow

9
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,663
Because  when it comes...

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,194
Better hope you've met your quota

11
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,600
Or you will end up just like the rest of the land...
